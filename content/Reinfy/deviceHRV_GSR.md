### what device can measure hrv and GSR simultaneously
There are devices on the market that can measure both HRV (Heart Rate Variability) and GSR (Galvanic Skin Response) simultaneously. Some of these devices are:

Empatica E4 wristband: This wearable device measures GSR along with other physiological signals, including heart rate (which can be used to calculate HRV), skin temperature, and motion. The E4 supports Bluetooth connectivity for data transmission.

NeXus-10 MKII or NeXus-32: These devices, developed by Mind Media, are versatile biofeedback and neurofeedback systems that can measure a range of physiological signals, including GSR and HRV, by attaching appropriate sensors.

Shimmer3 GSR+ Development Kit: This research-grade GSR measurement kit can also measure heart rate and other physiological signals when paired with additional sensors. The Shimmer3 GSR+ supports Bluetooth connectivity.

Please note that while these devices can measure both GSR and HRV simultaneously, the specific setup, configuration, and additional sensors may be needed to enable these measurements. It is crucial to consult the manufacturer's guidelines and technical documentation for details on how to achieve this dual measurement setup.



### roughly price of these devices
As an AI language model, I don't have real-time pricing information. However, I can provide you with a rough price range based on historical data. Please note that these prices may change over time and depending on your location, so it is essential to check the manufacturer's website or authorized retailers for the most accurate and up-to-date pricing.

Empatica E4 wristband: The price of the Empatica E4 wristband has been historically around $1,700 USD for the research edition. However, this device is primarily targeted at researchers and may not be available for individual consumers.

NeXus-10 MKII or NeXus-32: These devices can vary in price depending on the specific configuration and included sensors. For a basic setup, the NeXus-10 MKII system has been historically priced around $3,000 - $4,000 USD, while the NeXus-32 system can range from $5,000 - $8,000 USD or even higher, depending on the configuration and included accessories.

Shimmer3 GSR+ Development Kit: The Shimmer3 GSR+ Development Kit's price varies based on the configuration and additional sensors. The basic GSR+ Development Kit has been historically priced around $1,000 - $1,500 USD.

Remember that prices can change over time and may vary depending on factors like taxes, shipping, and import fees. It is important to check the manufacturer's website or contact authorized retailers for the most accurate and up-to-date pricing information.
